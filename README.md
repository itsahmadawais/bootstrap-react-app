# My React App

This is a simple React application that makes use of the following packages:

-   Bootstrap: A popular CSS framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites.
-   React-Bootstrap: A library that allows you to use Bootstrap components in a React application, saving you time and effort in setting up basic styling.
-   React-Icons: A library that provides a wide variety of icons to use in your application, making it easy to add visual elements to your app.
-   React-Router-Dom: A library that allows you to handle client-side routing in your React application, making it easy to navigate between different pages and views.

With these tools in place, you can spend more time focusing on the main functionality of your app, rather than on setup and styling.
